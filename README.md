##### Note :-
Emojis in the embed will not work unless your bot has access to them. You have two options: 
1. Upload all emojis to the Discord Developer Portal's bot emojis API. Replace markdown with `config/emojis.js` respective emojis.
2. Alternatively, you can upload the emojis to a server and replace the IDs in the `config/emojis.js` file with the corresponding emoji IDs. Ensure that your bot is in the same server as the emojis you are using.

Checkout emojis folder to get all your emojis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) v14 - A powerful JavaScript library for interacting with the Discord API
- [discord-player](https://discord-player.js.org/) v6 - A robust framework for creating music bots
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A flexible NoSQL database for storing guild settings

## Prefix Commands
By default, prefix commands are disabled in all servers. Server administrators can enable or disable prefix commands using the `/prefix-commands` slash command.

To enable prefix commands:
1. Use `/prefix-commands enabled:true`
To disable prefix commands:
1. Use `/prefix-commands enabled:false`

## 🔜 Future Plans

I'm working to improve EarthX and expand its capabilities. Here's what's on the horizon:

- 🛡️ Moderation commands for server management
